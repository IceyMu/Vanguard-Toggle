# Vanguard Toggle

***Riot now has an official way to toggle Vanguard which should be used instead***

Batch script for toggling whether or not Riot's Vanguard anti cheat is allowed to run on boot.

To use either:
- Add the batch file to your path so you can call it with `tog_van` in the command prompt.
- Create a desktop shortcut to the batch file.

This script needs to be run as administrator to work.

***To play Valorant you will still need to enable Vanguard and reboot you computer if it has been disabled***

Vanguard can be explicitly turned by running it with the option `1` or `on` and turned off by running with `0` or `off`.
